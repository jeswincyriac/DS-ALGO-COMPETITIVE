A class is a reference type. When an object of the class is created, the variable to which the object is assigned holds only a reference to that memory. Changes made through one variable are reflected in the other variable because they both refer to the same data.A struct is a value type. When a struct is created, the variable to which the struct is assigned holds the struct's actual data. When the struct is assigned to a new variable, it is copied. The new variable and the original variable therefore contain two separate copies of the same data. Changes made to one copy do not affect the other copy. Structures are stored as a stack on memory. where as class are reference type so they are stored as heap on memory.
Members of a class are private by default and members of struct are public by default.
In general, classes are used to model more complex behavior, or data that is intended to be modified after a class object is created. Structs are best suited for small data structures that contain primarily data that is not intended to be modified after the struct is created.
A structure can't be abstract, a class can.
A structure is contain only data member , but class contain data member and member function.
In a Structure we can't initialize the value to the variable but in class variable we assign the values.
Classes can be inherited whereas structures not.
A structure couldn't have a destructor such as a class.
The structure can't contain a volatile field whereas the class can.
You can't use sizeof with classes but you can with structures.
Fields are automatically initialized with classes to 0/false/null whereas structures are not.
